## Keyboard Layout Image

![UltimateKEYS - Keyboard Layout Image](images/UltimateKEYS%20-%20Keyboard%20Layout%20Image.png)

=&gt; CP key (blue) : &nbsp;**[Compose Key](https://pieter-degroote.github.io/UltimateKEYS/documentation.html#Compose_Key_Sequences)** (Multi_key), in combination with AltGr (Right Alt).  
=&gt; Note that the ISO key (next to Left Shift) is not present on standard ANSI keyboards.

## AutoHotkey - Caps Lock modifications

These modifications feature a second AltGr (Right Alt) or Backspace key via Caps Lock.  
The classic Caps Lock behavior can be triggered (or toggled) by pressing both Shift keys together.  
See the folder **`ahk-capslock-mods`** for instructions.

## AutoHotkey - US / KBDUSX (US-Int.)

These modifications allow the AutoHotkey scripts to work on both "US QWERTY" and "US-International" as base layouts.  
See the folder **`ahk-us-kbdusx`** for instructions.

## UltimateKEYS - Colemak Variant

Colemak variant of UltimateKEYS - This variant uses Colemak as its primary (or base) layout and features UltimateKEYS as its secondary (AltGr) layout.  
See the folder **`colemak`** (for AutoHotkey v2 and v1.1 on Windows, and XKB/Xmodmap on Linux).

## UltimateKEYS - Grave Accent mod

This version features a dead key on the grave accent (upper-left key) and on the ISO key (if present).  
These keys allow the user to enter most of the diacritics and symbols as the AltGr (Right Alt) modifier already does (for the main layout).  
See the folder **`grave-accent-mod`** for instructions.

## UltimateKEYS - '.keylayout' format (macOS)

A '.keylayout' file for macOS (without Compose Key). Note that this work is still in its testing stage (install/integrate at your own risk!).  
Please carefully read the 'Known Issues - Disclaimer' section in its README.md *before* installing/integrating&nbsp;!  
See the folder **`keylayout`** for further details.

## UltimateKEYS - SW ('Switched') Variant

With this modification, the symbols !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, \*, (, ) are directly accessible and the numbers via Shift.  
See the folder **`sw-variant`** for further details.
